A multiplayer game that I've been creating on stream at [twitch.tv/codeheir](https://www.twitch.tv/codeheir) as a fun little project, it started off as an asteroids replica, but idea after idea has led me to this space game! 

Go play the game in its current state at [spaceheir.com!](http://spaceheir.com/)
## Some of the stuff to do!
Feel free to branch and play around, go to https://trello.com/b/HBwddn26/stream-royale-game to see what needs doing!
