# Codeheir space game
## Some of the stuff to do!
https://trello.com/b/HBwddn26/stream-royale-game

A multiplayer game that I've been creating on stream at [twitch.tv/codeheir](https://www.twitch.tv/codeheir) as a fun little project, it started off as an asteroids replica, but idea after idea has led me to this space game! 

I've just recently (As of 2019) started developing on this again as It's so fun to do. 

Go play the game in its current state at [spaceheir.com!](http://spaceheir.com/)


Feel free to branch and play around, go to https://trello.com/b/HBwddn26/stream-royale-game to see what needs doing!
